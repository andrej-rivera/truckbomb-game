## About

This is a chaotic, endless, arcade driving game where you must multitask to survive.
Developed during Spring 2023 for the Game Dev Club @ SJSU.
Good luck :)

## How to Play

- Use A and D to change lanes
- When you crash, you must repair the truck by completing a minigame
- You lose when you have more than four minigames
- Collect 40 bolts to earn a speed boost (with immunity of course)

## Minigame Tips

- ENGINE: Just spam click on the vent.
- WHEEL: Move the mouse clockwise to turn the wrench.
- RADIO: Click and drag left or right on the dial to tune it.
- BOMB: You have 10 seconds to enter the correct code or you instantly lose!
